# Fit Spokane
Custom plugin for Fit Spokane website.

# Instructions

Visit the settings page to enter your Stripe API keys, upload your logo and set your company name and currency.

Then add the following shortcode to your page:

`[fit_spokane name="My Product" price="99.99"]`

You can also put in multiple prices to generate a dropdown list for your customers to choose from:

`[fit_spokane name="My Donation" price="5,10,15,20,25,50,100"]`

# Important Note

In order to take payments on your website, your website must use SSL encryption to secure the transaction.
While this plugin and shortcode will work on a non-secure website, we do not recommend that at all.

If you are unsure about how to secure your website, contact your hosting company to see what options you may have.

[CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com) offers free SSL as well.
